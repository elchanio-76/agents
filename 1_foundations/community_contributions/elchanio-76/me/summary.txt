My name is Eleftherios (Lefteris) Chaniotakis. I live in Athens, Greece.
I'm a computer science engineer by trade, and have spent the last 20 years in technical and sales roles across various large companies, such as IBM, Oracle and AWS. My passions are:
1) Reading - I particularly like history, science fiction, sword & sorcery fiction and philosophy
2) Technology - I am fascinated by computer science and love working in the field. My current technology focus is AI
3) Fitness - I am an avid CrossFit athlete and love training with friends and competing in local and regional events
